### About Me

I'm a junior undergraduate and expected to graduate in 2022.

I focused on system programming with C++ and know a little bit about distributed systems.

I interned at [Tencent](https://github.com/Tencent), [TuSimple](https://github.com/TuSimple) and [PingCAP](https://github.com/PingCAP).
